18.5,"Cummins to Miller,1 run","Wide and slow. Miller shapes to cut, may have considered letting it go as it might've been wide but then held back on going through with the cut. Gets it to deep point"

15.6,"Markande to Miller,SIX runs","24 runs off the over and that is likely to be decisive. Not violent but it travels far. Looped up on the fuller side of length outside off, Miller takes a small stride across, reaches out with his upper body and free-swings it with a rotational arc"
15.5,"Markande to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Wide on a fullish length, reaches out and has a one-handed swipe to point"
15.4,"Markande to B Sai Sudharsan,SIX runs",GT have marked their target and these two turning it in their favour in this over. Sudharsan dances down and thumps it over wide long-on with a free swing

15.3,"Markande to Miller,1 wide","Wide again, outside off and goes past the bat swing"

15.1,"Markande to Miller,FOUR runs","Miller finally connects, clubs it between long-on and deep midwicket. Was a length ball tossed up outside off. Miller hasn't been running freely, so he might be looking to break free"
15.1,"Markande to Miller,1 wide","Wide on a length, goes too far away and is let go"
14.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Miller,1 run","Bhuvi has Miller reaching out to end the over quietly. Length ball, he had to reach out and try to carve it. Plinked it to the left of short third"

14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run",Clips the length ball to deep midwicket
14.4,"Bhuvneshwar to B Sai Sudharsan,1 wide","Bumper goes too high. 129ks, fifth-stump line, Sudharsan wound down and then leapt to try and go for another upper cut but it kept sponging up"
14.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Miller,1 run","Length on middle and off, punched towards mid-off and Miller takes off for the run"
14.2,"Bhuvneshwar to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Upper cuts it fine. Ball rolls to deep third. 127ks and short, angling towards fifth, Sudharsan stood upright and helped it along, didn't get all the pace he was looking for"

13.4,"Sundar to Miller,1 run",Chops it from outside off to deep cover
13.3,"Sundar to Miller,2 runs","Quick two, full-length dive and slide. Miller takes two when it wasn't on. Was a length ball outside off that was cut to deep point's right. Shahbaz ran across and threw it like in regulation, maybe should've yanked it harder"
13.2,"Sundar to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Length middle, worked legside"
13.1,"Sundar to B Sai Sudharsan,FOUR runs","Uses the angle and the bounce, the shortish length ball rose just above pad height and was delicately pulled fine and in the gap"
12.6,"Cummins to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Length at the stumps, clipped to midwicket. Titans take the timeout early"
12.5,"Cummins to B Sai Sudharsan,FOUR runs","Sudharsan is ready for the pace-on Test-like ball. It's length over fourth, 139ks, he waits and guides it with an open face, wide of the diving short-third fielder"
12.5,"Cummins to B Sai Sudharsan,1 wide","Get the slower bouncer wrong for a change. This bounces too high. Line was outside off, Sudharsan jumped up to try and slap it high. Didn't have to in the end."

12.3,"Cummins to Miller,1 run","Pace on this time. 142ks, length around fifth, guided to deep third."
12.2,"Cummins to Miller,no run","Real short slower one. Tennis-ball bounce over fifth-stump, Miller is caught between shots. Ended up trying to knock it to the offside but underedged it to the grass behind"

11.6,"Unadkat to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Fullish and slow, worked to the legside"
11.5,"Unadkat to B Sai Sudharsan,FOUR runs","Similar shot to the first ball but this time he went straighter and higher. The length was fullish but line was around middle and off, pace on too, so he could pump it through the line with ease"
11.4,"Unadkat to Miller,1 run","Slower one has Miller defending closer to the body than he probably would've otherwise. 110ks, on a length, angling in towards off. He shaped to slap it but ended up bunting it towards point"
11.3,"Unadkat to Miller,no run","Length outside off, slapped to cover point"
11.2,"Unadkat to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Slower bouncer, 114ks, seemed like it turned in. Pulled from fourth stump to deep square leg"

9.6,"Markande to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Wide and full, driven to depp cover"

9.4,"Markande to Miller,1 run","Sits up for the cut, spun away too, so it must have been the googly. 83ks, hit to deep point"

9.2,"Markande to Miller,1 run","Fullish on off, worked to long-on"
9.1,"Markande to Gill,OUT","Gill holes out to long-on. Mistake in execution cos the ball was in his slot. Slow on leg, 89ks, he danced down and probably got too close to the pitch. Maybe he wanted to go wider. Markande and SRH will take that with both hands"
8.6,"Sundar to Gill,1 run","Length on fifth, steered to the left of deep point. Timeout called"
8.5,"Sundar to Gill,2 runs","Length on middle, clipped to the square-leg outfield. Fielder doesn't have to run that much but the batters scamper through anyway"

6.6,"Sundar to Gill,1 run","Fullish dart on leg, flicked to backward square leg"

6.4,"Sundar to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Square drives the length ball outside off, to the offside sweeper"

5.4,"Bhuvneshwar to B Sai Sudharsan,FOUR runs","Not that bad a ball but he whips it through wicket nonchalantly. Length on middle and off in fact, Sudharsan didn't have to transfer weight and timed it perfectly"
5.3,"Bhuvneshwar to B Sai Sudharsan,no run","Shortish and slow, 122ks, Sudharsan charged and tried to pull it. Not middled, goes to midwicket"

4.5,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Gill,1 run","Full and at the body, worked to midwicket"

4.2,"Shahbaz Ahmed to B Sai Sudharsan,1 run","Length on leg, clipped to deep midwicket"
4.1,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Saha,OUT","Change of ends works for Shahbaz. He went fuller side of length, 89ks, at the stumps. Saha lunged forward but had to reach too far forward as he tried to lift it over midwicket. Having to do it on the up didn't help. Ends up spooning it."
3.6,"Unadkat to Saha,1 run","Fullish on middle and leg, 112ks, whisked to midwicket"

3.4,"Unadkat to Gill,1 run","Fullish on fourth, pushed to long-off"
3.3,"Unadkat to Saha,1 run",Slower one negates Saha's dance down the pitch. The into-the-pitch ball goes under the bat as he tried to pull. Actually took an underedge onto body before dribbling to the offside

3.1,"Unadkat to Saha,1 run","Pitched up, angling away through fifth, driven to the left of long-off"
2.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Saha,1 run",Clips the length ball on the pads to deep fine leg
2.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Saha,FOUR runs","Dances down and lofts it over wide mid-off. Slower one, 119ks, picks up the length ball and forces it despite not getting all that close to the pitch. Bat-face turned but the power was enough to get it into the outfield"
2.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,1 run","Fullish on fifth, guided with an angled bat, to the right of backward point"
2.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,no run","Fullish on the pads, clipped to midwicket"
2.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,no run","Check-bunt, pops up but goes to midwicket on the bounce. Back of length, 136ks, just outside off, Gill shaped to pull but pulled back due to the bit of spongy extra bounce"
2.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Saha,1 run","Length in the channel, pulled off the bottom-half of the bat, to the side of the diving midwicket fielder"
1.6,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Saha,1 run","Full outside off, driven to long-off"
1.5,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Gill,1 run","Length on middle, worked to midwicket"
1.4,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Saha,1 run","Uppish but wide to the right of the bowler. Went over head too, so it was too far of the leaping bowler. Length just outside off, Saha tried cuffing it with a flat bat, the face seemed to turn on impact"
1.3,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Saha,SIX runs","Walking whip over cow corner. Overpitched on the pads, 91ks, Saha took a step forward, lifted the back leg up and flicked it seamlessly"
1.2,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Gill,1 run","Length outside off, punched to long-off"
1.1,"Shahbaz Ahmed to Saha,1 run","Full on the pads, given air, clipped to midwicket"
0.6,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,no run","Fullish on leg, tries to work it across to the leg side. Goes off the outer-half of the bat, into the pitch and back to the bowler"
0.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,FOUR runs","Bhuvi pulls his length back and Gill short-arm slaps it through cover. He walked into the stroke, had a bit of width and crunched it with the cross-bat. Follow-through stopped halfway as he held the pose"
0.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,no run","Length around sixth, goes back and pushes it to cover. Not much swing"
0.3,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,no run","Stirred to backward point. Length on fifth, defended slightly away from the body"
0.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gill,2 runs","Fullish in the channel, induces the thick outside edge. But Gill played it with low hands, so it went along the ground and to the left of deep-backward point"
0.1,"Bhuvneshwar to Saha,1 run","Guided past backward point, stopped at deep third. Was a length ball in the channel"
