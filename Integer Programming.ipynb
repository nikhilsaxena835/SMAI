    "### Interpreting the Output : \n",
    "For each player, a performance score is computed — derived from pairwise interactions. In the output, the final objective value represents the sum of selected players’ performance contributions (multiplied by 100) for numerical stability during optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the absolute magnitude of the score may appear lower than expected. The formulation is theoretically sound, as evidenced by the solver reaching an optimal solution without invoking any branching, cutting planes, or node expansion. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The problem was well-constrained and solvable using heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The feasibility pump found a valid integer solution immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * No time was spent exploring alternate solutions via branch-and-bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solver output consists of two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Objective Function Value:\n",
    "    The cumulative performance score for the selected team.\n",
    "    This value is what the model seeks to maximize, subject to all constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Selected Playing XI:\n",
    "    The optimal team composition as determined by the solver — adhering to role requirements (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, etc.) and maximizing the team’s overall performance potential under the given model.\n",
