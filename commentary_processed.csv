Ball Number,Summary,Description,over,ball,Ball
0.1,"Malinga to Smith,no run","Malinga starts with a ball that lasers in towards the batsman's toes, Smith gets his feet out of the way and defends that from within the crease, superb start from Malinga",0,1,1
0.2,"Malinga to Smith,no run","length ball swerving away just outside off, there's a typical Dwayne Smith slog, meets thin air",0,2,2
0.3,"Malinga to Smith,no run","length ball on middle and leg, cramps up Smith who blocks it towards mid-on",0,3,3
0.4,"Malinga to Smith,FOUR runs","length ball is slugged off the front foot past cover, this is a quick outfield at Eden Gardens and Smith has connected well, that's four",0,4,4
0.5,"Malinga to Smith,no run","slingy full ball from Malinga, punched back towards the bowler who takes the sting out of that shot with an outstretched right hand",0,5,5
0.6,"Malinga to Smith,1 run","full and on the pads, Smith gets deep in the crease and taps the ball towards midwicket for a single to keep the strike, just five off the first over",0,6,6
1.1,"McClenaghan to Smith,no run","swing and a miss from Smith, pitching on a length and angling across past the outside edge beyond off",1,1,7
1.2,"McClenaghan to Smith,no run","back of a length ball on middle and leg, sliced towards point, can't get it past the fielder there",1,2,8
1.3,"McClenaghan to Smith,no run","a touch short, a bit of width, slapped towards backward point, Pollard dives to his left to cut that off",1,3,9
1.4,"McClenaghan to Smith,SIX runs","Smith was feeling the pressure there after some dots, he goes for his favourite swipe towards midwicket, a thick top edge over the keeper's head for six, lucky but that should settle him a bit",1,4,10
1.5,"McClenaghan to Smith,1 run","a short of length ball lashed back towards the bowler, McClenaghan gets his hand on that and the ball rolls towards mid-on",1,5,11
1.6,"McClenaghan to Hussey,no run","Hussey, facing his first ball, goes for a pull as he sees the ball a bit short, he misses",1,6,12
2.1,"Malinga to Smith,no run","back of a length ball on off stump, defended back towards the bowler",2,1,13
2.2,"Malinga to Smith,1 run","into the pads, short of length, clipped towards square leg for a single",2,2,14
2.3,"Malinga to Hussey,no run","full toss outside off, Hussey looks to steer that through the covers, can't find the gap, plenty of dot balls already in this CSK innings",2,3,15
2.4,"Malinga to Hussey,1 leg bye","length ball on the pads, thuds off the pad towards backward square leg",2,4,16
2.5,"Malinga to Smith,no run","slower length ball from Malinga, on middle stump, patted back towards the bowler",2,5,17
2.6,"Malinga to Smith,1 run","that was a wide down the leg side - if the batsman had let it go. Smith wanted to help that past short fine leg for four, but he can only send it to the fielder there for a single",2,6,18
3.1,"Vinay to Smith,no run","short of a length, on off, opens the face but doesn't get a single",3,1,19
3.2,"Vinay to Smith,1 run","Smith's head falls away as he looks to pull, gets a single to long-on off the mis-hit",3,2,20
3.3,"Vinay to Hussey,no run","length ball outside off, angling away, squeezes under the bat as Hussey looks to drive. Low bounce there",3,3,21
3.4,"Vinay to Hussey,1 wide","another length ball beats the drive, but this is somewhat harshly called a wide",3,4,22
3.4,"Vinay to Hussey,no run",and Hussey is struggling to lay bat on ball. Beaten third time in a row on the drive as a length ball angles across him,3,4,23
3.5,"Vinay to Hussey,no run",and beaten on another cover drive. This time on the inside edge as the ball holds its line as opposed to going with the angle,3,5,24
3.6,"Vinay to Hussey,FOUR runs","finally gets bat on the cover-drive, drilling it over extra cover, inches away from the leap of Simmons there",3,6,25
4.1,"McClenaghan to Smith,no run","heavy ball, on a length, middle and off. Hits the bat as opposed to the other way around. The leading edge goes to cover-point",4,1,26
4.2,"McClenaghan to Smith,1 run","on a length, pretty quick, no room, pushed to mid-off for one",4,2,27
4.3,"McClenaghan to Hussey,no run","short of a length, extra bounce, McLenaghan is giving this everything. Beats Hussey's cut with the bounce",4,3,28
4.4,"McClenaghan to Hussey,OUT","wide full ball, Hussey sees some release, he drives it hard, goes uppishly to cover-point where Suchith seems to have taken a low catch but immediately says he is not sure. The soft signal as they go upstairs is not out. To me it looks like it bounced straight on the fingers. Mumbai have begun to celebrate as they look at the big screen. They are not even waiting for the official decision. That looks out to me. It looks like it has bounced, but it has bounced in his fingers that have kept the ball from touching the ground. Finally given out officially",4,4,29
4.5,"McClenaghan to Raina,no run","a sharp mean bouncer. Raina is not looking at the ball, throwing his hands up in defence like Mayweather against Pacquiao. But will Raina end with his hand raised?",4,5,30
4.6,"McClenaghan to Raina,FOUR runs","and again. Raina hopping and skipping against quality fast bowling. Dug in short, he has no idea, throws his arms up in self defence, and gets an edge wide of slip",4,6,31
5.1,"Vinay to Smith,FOUR runs","Smith takes a risk, gets a big outside edge that flies over point. Two last balls, two edges, 8 runs. Is the break Super Kings are looking for?",5,1,32
5.2,"Vinay to Smith,no run","short of a length, punched straight to extra cover",5,2,33
5.3,"Vinay to Smith,no run","Smith is just swinging and hoping for the best. This short-of-a-length delivery stays a little low, moves back in a touch, and beats the slog",5,3,34
5.4,"Vinay to Smith,no run","another slog, and this one skids through to hit him on the pad",5,4,35
5.5,"Vinay to Smith,1 run","short of a length, outside off, pushed to long-on for one",5,5,36
5.6,"Vinay to Raina,no run","short of a length, middle and leg, angles away and stays low to beat the outside edge",5,6,37
6.1,"Hardik to Smith,FOUR runs",short-arm pull as Pandya bowls short into the ribs. That's Smith's favourite shot. Gets four past fine leg,6,1,38
6.2,"Hardik to Smith,1 run","short again, this time it skids on and hurries Smith into the pull. The bottom edge goes for one",6,2,39
6.3,"Hardik to Raina,1 leg bye","short of a length, beats Raina for pace, hits the pad, goes for a single off the inside edge",6,3,40
6.4,"Hardik to Smith,no run","short of a length, outside off, moves in a little beats the inside edge as he looks to work this to leg",6,4,41
6.5,"Hardik to Smith,no run","short of a length, wide outside off, but it shoots through to beat the bottom edge",6,5,42
6.6,"Hardik to Smith,1 run","short of a length, into the pads, worked away for a single",6,6,43
7.1,"Harbhajan to Smith,FOUR runs","reverse-sweeps the first ball as Harbhajan is a bit flat. Beats short third man, gets four",7,1,44
7.2,"Harbhajan to Smith,1 run","slog-sweeps this one, but gets only a single to deep midwicket as the ball is too full for him to get under",7,2,45
7.3,"Harbhajan to Raina,no run","short of a length, swerves in to beat the cut",7,3,46
7.4,"Harbhajan to Raina,2 runs","Raina jumps out of the crease, is nowhere near the pitch of the ball, but it falls wide of long-on and speeds off after pitching on the a practice pitch. Gets two for it as rayudu makes an excellent save",7,4,47
7.5,"Harbhajan to Raina,1 run",chipped towards deep cover for one,7,5,48
7.6,"Harbhajan to Smith,FOUR runs","slogged away as this ball is pitched up, he has managed to place this straight of deep midwicket and gets a desperately needed boundary",7,6,49
8.1,"Hardik to Raina,1 run","Raina can't play the bouncer, Pandya knows it, and nearly gets him out. Raina has to hook, gets a top edge, and it somehow falls short of Simmons who is charging in from fine leg. Pandya is not happy with Simmons. He wanted more from the fielder",8,1,50
8.2,"Hardik to Smith,(no ball)",Pandya's response to that is a sharper bouncer. Right by SMith's nose it goes. Called no-ball because this is the second bouncer of the over. No free hit for this,8,2,51
8.2,"Hardik to Smith,no run","short of a length, and beats Smith as he backs away",8,2,52
8.3,"Hardik to Smith,FOUR runs","looks to slip in the full wide ball, Smith has backed away a touch but somehow gets bat on it and manages to place it between mid-off and extra cover",8,3,53
8.4,"Hardik to Smith,no run","short of a length, seams in a touch, beats the inside edge, hits the pad, draws another dot",8,4,54
8.5,"Hardik to Smith,no run","big shout. This is short of a length, outside off, and skids through and seams in to hit him dead in  front. Dharmasena doesn't give him. He thinks it is too high as this has hit Smith on the knee roll, but his leg is bent and he is deep in the crease. Awfully close, this. Hitting the top of middle for mine",8,5,55
8.6,"Hardik to Smith,1 run",punched to deep cover for one,8,6,56
9.1,"Harbhajan to Smith,1 run","topspinner, Smith stays back to work this to leg for one",9,1,57
9.2,"Harbhajan to Raina,1 run","full and straight, nearly a yorker, can't get under it. Takes a single to long-off. Bowled at 102ks",9,2,58
9.3,"Harbhajan to Smith,no run","flighted outside off, Smith looks for the slog sweep and is beaten comprehensively",9,3,59
9.4,"Harbhajan to Smith,no run","looks for the reverse-sweep, gets an edge that falls short of short third man. Smith has not only played an ordinary shot but is also caught sleeping. He sends Raina back even though this is Raina's call and he would have made the run easily. Smith caught ball-watching",9,4,60
9.5,"Harbhajan to Smith,1 run",swept away for one,9,5,61
9.6,"Harbhajan to Raina,1 wide","Harbhajan goes full, wide and fast, and Raina stands his ground. Called a wide",9,6,62
9.6,"Harbhajan to Raina,SIX runs","Raina finally plays a convincing shot. Dances down the ground, is not close to the pitch of the ball but that only means he has room to swing his arms. Over long-on he goes for six",9,6,63
10.1,"Hardik to Smith,FOUR runs","short ball, Smith plays the short-arm pull, places it between deep square and deep midwicket",10,1,64
10.2,"Hardik to Smith,1 run","looks for the big drive to a length ball, gets a thick edge that falls short of third man",10,2,65
10.3,"Hardik to Raina,FOUR runs",this bouncer doesn't get as high as the earlier ones. This is only chest high and Raina pulls this through square leg for four,10,3,66
10.4,"Hardik to Raina,no run","Smith is caught ball-watching again. There is a big lbw shout here, but the ball has clearly pitched outside leg. Raina wants a leg-bye to short third man but Smith hasn't moved. raina is nearly run out but Harbhajan misses on the direct hit",10,4,67
10.5,"Hardik to Raina,1 run","straight to short fine, this time they run through, and a wide throw from Malinga makes the single possible",10,5,68
10.6,"Hardik to Smith,FOUR runs","lovely shot to bring up his fifty. Short of a length, just outside off, and somehow Smith makes some room. Meets this with an open face, placing it to the left of point and right of third man. Top shot",10,6,69
11.1,"Harbhajan to Raina,1 run","Rains looks for the chip over cover, but Rohit has blocked that shot with Pollard at deep extra cover. Single",11,1,70
11.2,"Harbhajan to Smith,1 run","short of a length, pulled towards deep midwicket for one",11,2,71
11.3,"Harbhajan to Raina,1 run","Raina charges down, turning this into a low full toss, and Harbhajan misfields in his follow-through to allow a single",11,3,72
11.4,"Harbhajan to Smith,FOUR runs","only slightly short of a length, Smith rocks back to turn this into a proper short ball and pulls this between long-on an deep midwicket for a scorching four. The cheerleaders there nearly cleaned up",11,4,73
11.5,"Harbhajan to Smith,OUT","Illingworth has given Smith out lbw again. This time, though, he is plumb. This is a topsinner, pitched just outside off, doesn;t turn as much as an offbreak would, beats the sweep and hits him in front of middle. This is straightforward",11,5,74
11.6,"Harbhajan to Dhoni,1 run","slow in the air, low full toss, driven to long-off for one. Dhoni and Harbhajan share a joke or something. Both are laughing",11,6,75
12.1,"Hardik to Dhoni,no run","short of a length, outside off, beats the punch of Dhoni",12,1,76
12.2,"Hardik to Dhoni,no run","short of a length again, and beats Dhoni for pace again. Hits his thigh pad as he looks to work this to leg",12,2,77
12.3,"Hardik to Dhoni,2 runs",this time he pitches up and Dhoni gets bat on ball. Gets two runs with a punch in front of point,12,3,78
12.4,"Hardik to Dhoni,1 run",dances down to drive this short-of-a-length ball for one,12,4,79
12.5,"Hardik to Raina,2 runs","slower ball, Raina slogs, gets a thick inside edge for two to deep midwicket",12,5,80
12.6,"Hardik to Raina,FOUR runs","Rain finally gets four for his chip over cover. They have a deep cover placed for this shot, but this time Raina places it straight of the man",12,6,81
13.1,"Harbhajan to Dhoni,1 run","short of a length, offbreak, punched to deep cover for one",13,1,82
13.2,"Harbhajan to Raina,no run","tossed up outside off, driven but straight to cover-point",13,2,83
13.3,"Harbhajan to Raina,OUT","Harbhajan has another wicket. Raina won't get 400 for the season. Lovely stumping from Parthiv Patel. Harbhajan sees Raina coming, slips in a quick wide ball that lands just short of the popping crease, but Patel makes a superb collection and whips the bail off. Raina is down on ground, and so are Super Kings",13,3,84
13.4,"Harbhajan to Dwayne Bravo,2 runs","offbreak, on the pads, worked away fine",13,4,85
13.5,"Harbhajan to Dwayne Bravo,no run","lovely bowling. Slow through the air, dipping on him, goes straight on, beats the outside edge",13,5,86
13.6,"Harbhajan to Dwayne Bravo,1 run","length-ball offbreak, worked to leg for a single. Harbhajan has hurt himself trying to collect this throw but he has bowled an excellent spell here",13,6,87
14.1,"McClenaghan to Dwayne Bravo,SIX runs","length ball, on the pads, angling away towards off, Bravo lofts this down the ground. A mis-hit but straight of long-on",14,1,88
14.2,"McClenaghan to Dwayne Bravo,no run","on a length, middle and leg, beats him with the angle here",14,2,89

14.5,"McClenaghan to Dhoni,FOUR runs","this is proper short ball, and he has cleared the front leg to pull this to deep square for four",14,5,92
14.6,"McClenaghan to Dhoni,no run","short of a length, on off, gets extra bounce, beats the edge as the asking rate crosses three a ball",14,6,93
15.1,"Malinga to Negi,1 run","yorker outside off, dug out to deep cover for one",15,1,94
15.2,"Malinga to Dhoni,SIX runs","misses the yorker by inches. Dhoni goes back deep into the crease, takes this on the half-volley and lofts this over long-on. A semi helicopter",15,2,95
15.3,"Malinga to Dhoni,1 run","this is the yorker, and he just gets a single to long-on. Despite that six they are going slower than the asking rate this over",15,3,96
15.4,"Malinga to Negi,(no ball) 1 run",no ball but not a free hit as he has hit the stumps with his front knee as he loads up to bowl. And that shortish ball beats Negi all ends up with pace,15,4,97
15.4,"Malinga to Dhoni,2 runs","low full toss, he has placed it square of deep midwicket for two",15,4,98
15.5,"Malinga to Dhoni,OUT","slower-ball yorker. Gets under his bat, lands on the crease, hits the bat pad as he is on his knees trying to get under it. The ball ricochets off the pad, and hits the stumps. Malinga is called back to take a wicket, and he has taken out the big one",15,5,99
15.6,"Malinga to du Plessis,1 run","slower full ball, played with an open face, gets a single to point",15,6,100
16.1,"Vinay to du Plessis,no run","wide length ball, it shapes away to beat du Plessis' drive",16,1,101
16.2,"Vinay to du Plessis,OUT","du Plessis is down the wicket to drive at this wide and full ball, and can't clear extra cover. Another wicket falls. CSK could get bowled out here",16,2,102
16.3,"Vinay to Jadeja,FOUR runs",gets a freebie first up. A leg-stump half-volley that he glances away for four. Only about 19 of those required,16,3,103
16.4,"Vinay to Jadeja,1 run","full, middle and leg, driven to long-on for one",16,4,104
16.5,"Vinay to Negi,1 run","yorker, middle and leg, gets a single to long-on",16,5,105

17.3,"Malinga to Negi,OUT","slower ball again. Malinga doesn't need to exerts himself on yorkers now. This is short of a length, on the pads, gets Negi's leading edge, and lobs for an easy catch to point",17,3,110
17.4,"Malinga to Ashwin,1 run","slower ball again, on off, Ashwin opens the face for a single",17,4,111
17.5,"Malinga to Jadeja,1 run","another slower ball to end the over, Ashwin opens the face for another single",17,5,112

18.1,"McClenaghan to Ashwin,no run","full and wide, angling away, beats the outside edge as Ashwin looks to steer this square",18,1,114
18.2,"McClenaghan to Ashwin,OUT","another wicket goes down. A serious chance to bowl Super Kings out. Ashwin looks for a big hit, gets too under a length ball and is caught at wide long-on",18,2,115

19.2,"Vinay to Mohit,2 runs","Mohit gives him the charge, yorks himself, gets a single to mid-off, and then an overthrow from Rohit. he laughs as he apologises to Vinay. He can afford to now",19,2,121
19.3,"Vinay to Mohit,SIX runs",that's the flicker of the dying flame. Mohit backs away to smoke this short ball over extra cover for a big six,19,3,122
19.4,"Vinay to Mohit,2 runs","slows away at a full ball, gets a thick edge over point, and Suchith - not asked to bowl today - puts in an excellent save still. He could have taken it easy but hasn't",19,4,123
19.5,"Vinay to Mohit,SIX runs","full length ball on off, he makes room and smashes this over extra cover for six",19,5,124
19.6,"Vinay to Mohit,FOUR runs","top edge over the keeper's head, but Mumbai Indians don't care where the ball has gone. This is a legal delivery, and that means they have won the IPL again",19,6,125
