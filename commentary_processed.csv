6.6,"Hardik to Gaikwad,no run",Gill misses a run-out opportunity.He can't throw the stumps down. Saha isn't close enough to the stumps either. Gill has his hands on his head. Gaikwad tips it to cover and takes off. Gill swoops down on the ball. Gaikwad has to undo his steps. Gaikwad would've been out had Gill nailed a direct hit,6,6,43

12.3,"Little to Gaikwad,FOUR runs","There's no stopping Gaikwad tonight. Williamson tried to stop him but he lands awkwardly on his right knee. Hip-high short ball on leg stump, Gaikwad hauls it over square leg. Williamson stretches across to his right and looks to parry the ball back into play but he loses his balance and when he lands the entire body weight is on his right knee. Ouch! Williamson has to leave the field. This looks nasty. He already has a niggly elbow to deal with. The ball bounced inside the field of play - so just a four for Gaikwad",12,3,76
12.4,"Little to Gaikwad,1 run",driven down to long-off for a single,12,4,77
12.5,"Little to Rayudu,OUT","Maiden IPL wicket for Josh Little. Rayudu dashes out of the crease, swings for the hills once again, but does not lay bat on ball. Little cranks it up to almost 140ks and nails the stumps",12,5,78

17.1,"Alzarri Joseph to Gaikwad,OUT","Joseph misses the yorker, but is still a hard-to-hit middle-stump full-toss, which is spliced into the hands of long-on. Is that a high full-toss? Gaikwad thinks so.Gaikwad has asked for a review. The umpires converge and ask for a review. The ball dips below the waist and therefore Gaikwad has to go. End of a terrific innings from Gaikwad.
