Ball,Ball Number,Bowler,Batsman,Runs,Description
1,0.1,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Away swing, low bounce, beats the outside edge. Landed around fourth on a length and finished farther, Rohit crouches and reaches out with an open-faced bat. Close call but gets away with it"
2,0.2,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,6,"Pulled behind square. Old-school Rohit, standing upright, waiting for the shortish ball to reach hip-height and helping it for a flat six."
3,0.3,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,2,"Touch too straight, clipped off the pads. Through square leg"
4,0.4,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Length on fourth, extra bounce. Good leave"
5,0.5,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"A bit of away movement, that was late swing. Landed around fifth and kept going away. Left alone"
6,0.5,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,N/A,"Wide and full, swing away but it's outside the tramline. Let go"
7,0.6,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Overpitched on fourth, 135ks, swing away. Driven softly, off the middle, to cover"
8,1.1,O'Rourke,Gill,0,"Three-quarter length on fifth, Gill happy to take a decent front stride and punch it firmly to cover"
9,1.2,O'Rourke,Rohit Sharma,0,"Fullish on fifth, 135ks, defended towards cover"
10,1.2,O'Rourke,Gill,N/A,"Tickles a leg glance this time, it's edgy. Half-volleys the keeper, wide enough to his left to ensure Latham can only parry it a few feet to his side. Was a full ball around leg"
11,1.2,O'Rourke,Gill,N/A,"Zips off the pitch but that's gone down leg. Fullish length ball delivered from slightly wide of the crease, landed around leg, swung after passing the batter as he tried to glance it"
12,1.3,O'Rourke,Rohit Sharma,4,"Flicked aerially but in the gap to the left of midwicket. 137ks, looked like the inswinger, picked off a fullish length off middle stump. Rohit playing it from the front of the body after standing still for most of the ball's path"
13,1.4,O'Rourke,Rohit Sharma,2,"Full on off, flicked along the ground this time. Through the gap at midwicket again, stopped in the outfield"
14,1.5,O'Rourke,Rohit Sharma,0,"Length on middle and off, 137ks, flicked to short midwicket. O'Rourke bowling to the field there. This one's come onto bat nicely"
15,1.6,O'Rourke,Rohit Sharma,4,"Spanked through cover, swing of the bat finishes behind shoulder. Was a good ball actually, on a length in the channel, Rohit holding onto a solid base and nailing it through the line"
16,2.1,Jamieson,Gill,1,"Almost-leave steer to deep third. Gill's bat was behind him, pointing towards the slip almost. The three-quarter-length ball went off the face of the bat, in the gap. Looked like he was in control though"
17,2.2,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,Wide-ish length ball let go
18,2.3,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Away movement and low bounce beats the pull. Looked like a length ball, maybe slightly back, and Rohit shaped for the pull early. He committed to fetching from outside off but the seam movement took it well away"
19,2.4,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Rohit takes a chance, it's an ugly miss but the ball goes over middle. Jamieson, and Phillips, have hands on heads. Pre-meditated shot, he danced down and made room to slog it over long-on. The 130ks length ball rose off the pitch and was wider than the bat swing. Rohit was nowhere near but gets away with it."
20,2.5,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,2,"Fullish on leg, clipped to the left of deep fine leg. 138ks"

24,3.3,O'Rourke,Gill,0,"Length on middle and off, 137ks, Gill slides across a touch and closes the flick to midwicket. Played without much weight transfer"
25,3.3,O'Rourke,Gill,N/A,Down leg. Four wides so far this innings. This was fullish and got decent bounce
26,3.4,O'Rourke,Gill,2,"Gill's arms swivel in a flash as he dances down and pulls to the left of deep fine leg. Ravindra charges and tumbles to stop it. Great shot though, 143ks shortish ball, yet Gill forced it with muscle"
27,3.5,O'Rourke,Gill,0,"Length in the channel, vertical-bat punch is firm and goes to cover"
28,3.6,O'Rourke,Gill,0,"Lbw appeal but that appeared to be going down leg. Fullish length ball at 137ks landed around off, might've swung in late. Gill's head fell over as he tried to hit it through midwicket"
29,4.1,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Seam-up. Length on middle, defensive flick takes it towards square leg"
30,4.2,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Punches the full ball on fourth, 135ks, to mid-off."
31,4.3,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Beaten on the aerial flick, Rohit wanted to go square, maybe even behind. There is deep square leg, 68 metres away. He saw the fullish ball angle in, lifted the back leg and tried to elevate it. Missed it completely"
32,4.4,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,1,Flicks the length ball off the pad through square leg
33,4.5,Jamieson,Gill,0,"Fullish on fifth, 130ks, might've swung back in a touch. Let go"

36,5.2,Smith,Rohit Sharma,0,"Length at the stumps, worked back to the bowler"
37,5.3,Smith,Rohit Sharma,6,"Rohit breaks free this time, that's a massive six over cow corner. Crowd love it. Pre-meditated. He danced down to a 137ks length ball, had a baseball swing across the hip. All horizontal, the ball sailed 92 metres far."
38,5.4,Smith,Rohit Sharma,0,"Smith follows him as he makes room this time. 136ks on a length, Rohit has to check his shot, jabs it into the off side of the pitch"
39,5.5,Smith,Rohit Sharma,1,"Length over top of middle, clipped through square leg"
40,5.6,Smith,Gill,1,"Length on off, 132ks, clipped to deep square leg, who moves to his diagonal right to stop it"
41,6.1,Jamieson,Gill,0,"Length on leg, defended to the bowler's right"
42,6.2,Jamieson,Gill,1,"Mitchell puts down a one-hander at midwicket. India missed a few half-chances, NZ have lost one. He leapt to his right, tried to take it just over head-height, his dive was stunted by the fact that he was too near to the ball. The hands extended, his left leg was up but the right leg and hand were flailing to the right, and the ball burst through. Graphic shows he was 24 metres far. Gill came down the track and tried to whip it. Off the bottom of the bat it came"
43,6.3,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Length on off, defended to cover"
44,6.4,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,4,"Rohit pulls it over midwicket. One-bounce four. Length ball, top-of-stump height at best. Rohit lifted it with a bat swing going from low to high. Got it flat too"
45,6.5,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,0,"Beaten on the flashing square drive. Back of a length, in the channel, might've bounced more than Rohit expected"
46,6.6,Jamieson,Rohit Sharma,1,"Length in the channel, open-faced slice takes it to the left of Phillips at backward point. He swoops and slides it keep it to one"
47,7.1,Smith,Rohit Sharma,0,"Pitched up, punchy drive takes it to mid-on"
48,7.2,Smith,Rohit Sharma,6,"And it reaches crescendo as the ball clears the straight boundary. Fifty up for India. He stood slightly leg side of the ball, the front foot strode out late, the bat whooshed through the line. The straight drive got a lot of height on it, felt for a second like it was too high, but no, it sailed 83 metres far. Peak height was 25 metres"
49,7.3,Smith,Rohit Sharma,0,"On the pads, looks to flick it. Off the pads it goes into grass"
50,7.4,Smith,Rohit Sharma,4,"Brilliant lap sweep lifted over short fine leg! Rohit's back foot was in front of middle, front foot outside off, the torso went across, the head was in line with the ball, Rohit drove the bat through and got it off the middle"
51,7.5,Smith,Rohit Sharma,0,Driven off a length while standing upright. Takes the length ball in the channel to cover
52,7.6,Smith,Rohit Sharma,4,"Slapped over point, NZ's pacers getting carted. This was wide, not too short but that didn't matter. Rohit stood in the crease and belted it after the ball came in line with him"
53,8.1,Santner,Gill,0,"Length on fourth, square driven late. Finds point. Santner gave it air, got good bounce. No spin though"
54,8.2,Santner,Gill,0,"Length on fourth, jabbed with a horizontal bat to cover"
55,8.3,Santner,Gill,0,"Good ball. On a length, off-stump line, 91ks. Gill looks to defend to the bowler's left, thick outside edge takes it towards point"

57,8.5,Santner,Rohit Sharma,0,"Full on off, defended to cover"
58,8.6,Santner,Rohit Sharma,0,"Fullish on middle, defended back to the bowler. 92ks. Think Rohit could've danced down the pitch and pumped it over the bowler's head, but he's not taking chances against Santner"
59,9.1,Ravindra,Gill,0,"A bit of turn away. 85ks, fullish length, landed around fourth and Gill drove it to cover. Ball hovered low and went to him on the bounce"
60,9.2,Ravindra,Gill,1,"Quick single to midwiclet. Length on middle and leg, flicked off the back foot. 94ks"
61,9.3,Ravindra,Rohit Sharma,0,"Full on leg, 93ks, pushed back to the bowler"
62,9.4,Ravindra,Rohit Sharma,1,"Full at the stumps, loopy, driven to long-off"
63,9.5,Ravindra,Gill,1,"Champan saves three at point. He was on the edge of the ring, moved to the left and dove to catch the ball after the passed him. Was a shortish ball outside off that was cut"
64,9.6,Ravindra,Rohit Sharma,1,"Length on fourth, punched to long-off"
65,10.1,Santner,Rohit Sharma,1,That is a top half-century for Rohit. A captain's knock just when it was needed the most.Gets there off just 41 balls and it's made India's chase very easy. He reaches there by driving Santner to deep cover

Was a length ball that landed around off and spun in sharply. Shreyas was going square on seamlessly but realised midway into the shot that he didn't account for the turn or the slowness.

Huge moment, he waslks back with his head down for most of the way back. Applause from the crowd but NZ are well in the game now. First ball of the over, Rohit looked to manufacture a boundary. Was a shortish ball outside off that spun away, was a pre-meditated shot from Rohit. He charged down and tried to slap it over cover"

174,28.2,Phillips,Shreyas Iyer,2,"Bad misfield at short third by O'Rourke, Run-out chance? Axar was three-fourth of the way down but the throw never comes. Young twisted his ankle as he turned which let Shreyas off the hook. Was a length ball outside off that Shreyas tried driving through cover."
175,28.3,Phillips,Shreyas Iyer,0,"Length at the stumps, worked to midwicket. 90ks"
